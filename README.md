Fork / upgrade from ![QAAS](https://github.com/gibranlp/QAAS), this OS Autoricing feature depends entirely on the Wallpaper, it generates several palettes using pywal and wpgtk to adapt the colors of the entire system to the wallpaper

## Installation

    - `git clone https://github.com/gibranlp/QARSlp.git`
